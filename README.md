**Carefinder** is a simple tool built with Typescript, React.js and Firebase that aims to help users find, export, and share hospitals in Lagos state.

**Features**

**Hospital Search**: Carefinder allows users to search for hospitals within their region in Lagos. Users can select from a list of nearby cities to find hospitals in their area. The platform will provide a list of hospitals and their respective contact details, including address, phone number, and email.

**Export Hospitals:** Carefinder allows users to export the list of hospitals to a CSV file, making it easy to save and share the information. 

**Share Hospitals:** Carefinder also allows users to share the list of hospitals with others. Users can share the information via email.
